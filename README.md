<h1 align="center"> üêç Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB</h1>

Hello! This code was developed by me using the python object oriented principles.

The objective of this code is turn easy the access and download data from database. This is an important step of Data Alytics because in this step we can filter and select a specific range of data relationed with a temporal time, or a type of information.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/tree/main/access_db">Here you can access the code.</a>Here you can access the code. I subdvided the code in three parts:

1. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/main.py">The first</a> part is the main archive, which information about the host, user, password, database and gateway are insert.
2. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/conectar_db.py">The second</a> archive which connect with the database.
3. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/download_tabela.py">The third</a> archive witch download and save the data in the machine.

I projected this code in a way to turn easy to change and addapting like the necessity of daily work.

If you like the code and you've suggestions, please, talk with me.
